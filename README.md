## üñ•Ô∏è Batch Mode

You can export package by using Unity's batch mode.

| Method                             | Arguments                        | Details                             |
|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| `PackageExporter.BatchMode.Export` | `_name`, `_version`, `_savePath` | Export package by unityignore name. |

| Command     | Optional | Details                                                          |
|:------------|:--------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `_name`     | ‚ùå       | Name of the exported package listed under unityignore directory. |
| `_version`  | ‚ùå       | Version of the exported package.                                 |
| `_savePath` | ‚ùå       | Where to save the exported package.                              |

For example,

```
$UNITY_PATH -batchmode -quit -projectPath "." -executeMethod PackageExporter.BatchMode.Export _name "Hello World" _version "0.1.0" _savePath "."
```

The `$UNITY_PATH` is the path to Unity executable hence it depends on variant OS.

On macOS,

```
/Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity
```

On Windows,

```
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Unity.exe"
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

#### üí´ Why should I use this package?

This is often use when you have multiple target to export but it's hard to
memorize all contents to export for each packages. This tool resolve these
issues, and provides a method similar to Git (Source Control) ignore system.

#### üí´ Should I commit .unityignore files to source control?

If you wish to share package export settings then yes, you should include
`.unityignore` files to repository. Other than that, the answer would be no.
